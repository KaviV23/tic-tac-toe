# Tic-Tac-Toe ⭕ ❌ 
A command-line based tic-tac-toe game made in Python!
This was a final exam project for my <i>programming fundamentals</i> university course.

⚙️ What I learned from creating this program:
1. Printing information & getting user input
2. Lists (used to store board states)
3. File processing (to log past game data)
4. Random integer (computer makes random move)
5. If statements
6. Loops
7. User-defined functions
8. Error handling (not using try/catch though, was not in the syllabus)
